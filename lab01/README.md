% groupId uniquely identifies your project across all projects. This means it starts with a reversed domain name you control. For example,
org.apache.maven, org.apache.commons

% artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it, then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar, you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed.
eg. maven, commons-math
